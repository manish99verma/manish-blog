      <h1>This is a brief introduction about me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Manish Kumar Verma. I am from nalanda (Bihar). I have
        completed my 12th from CBSE in 2020 with 83% with PCM. After that i had
        started learning to code through online resources. I started my journey
        with Android App Development. Where i developed many apps like VPN,
        Gallery locker, PUBG Wallpapers, Free Fire Wallpapers and many more. One
        of my app "PUBG Wallpapers" got over 500K downloads on playstore.
        Unfortunately my play console account got deactivated due to some
        trademark issues. Then i started learning Web Dev and made only one
        site,
        <a href="https://shayariyana.com" target="_blank">Shayariyana.com</a>
        with basic knowledge in html, css and javascript .Which currently have
        more than 500K monthly active users.
